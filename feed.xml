Votekit is an explorable sandbox that shows how different voting methods work. Single elections are presented visually using a spatial opinion model. Ensembles of elections are also presented with distributions of winning positions. (The rest of this description will become more accurate with time.) Some consideration of strategy is performed. Voting methods include single-winner systems like plurality, approval, condorcet methods, instant runoff, score, star, etc. Electoral methods also include proportional multi-member district methods like the Single Transferable Vote, Monroe, Thiele's Proportional Approval Voting, Phragmen's method, etc. Electoral methods also include party-list proportional methods like d'Hondt, Huntington-Hill, Webster, etc. Additional electoral methods include MMP and OLPR.</subtitle><author><name>Paretoman</name></author><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="https://paretoman.github.io/votekit-example/jekyll/update/2022/02/05/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2022-02-05T13:14:09-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-05T13:14:09-05:00</updated><id>https://paretoman.github.io/votekit-example/jekyll/update/2022/02/05/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://paretoman.github.io/votekit-example/jekyll/update/2022/02/05/welcome-to-jekyll.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
